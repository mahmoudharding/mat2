An intuitive way to think about it: for the perfectly strong correlations, the model gives 100% perfect predictions. The models explain $100\\%$ of the variation in the data, so $R^2 = 100\\%$. As the correlations get weaker, they start leaving room for error, since the models capture less of the variation in the data.
